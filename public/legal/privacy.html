      <p>
        Aluna is committed to protecting the security and conﬁdentiality of Your

      <h3>Safeguards</h3>
      <p>

        to notify You and provide information on protective steps, if available,
        through the e­mail address that You have provided to Us or by an
        internal notiﬁcation. Depending on where You live, You may have a legal
        right to receive such notices in writing.

        send You an e­mail requesting conﬁdential information such as account
