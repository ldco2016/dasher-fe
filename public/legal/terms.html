      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <h3>*PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS*</h3>
      <p>
        Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to Your satisfaction by
        emailing support at support@alunacare.com. In the unlikely event that
        our support team is unable to resolve a complaint You may have (or if We
        have not been able to resolve a dispute with You after attempting to do
        so informally), including but not limited to any alleged breach of these
        Terms, You and agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration
        in the before a single arbitrator, in accordance with the rules and
        procedures of the American Arbitration Association and the laws of
        without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. Arbitration, which
        is often less expensive, faster, and less formal than a lawsuit in
        court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators
        can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, and may,
        but do not have to, award legal fees, arbitrator’s fees and costs and
        other costs incurred by the party that does not win the dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual
        basis; <b>class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted</b>.
        Any arbitration will be strictly confidential and neither party will
        disclose to any person (other than necessary to carry out the
        arbitration) the existence of the dispute or any aspect of the dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or Aluna from seeking
        provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation
        orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral
        award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, this
        agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or Aluna from applying to a
        court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order,
        preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as
        necessary. THE PROPER VENUE FOR ANY ACTION PERMITTED UNDER THIS
        SUBSECTION REGARDING “EQUITABLE RELIEF” WILL BE THE FEDERAL AND STATE
        COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY
        OBJECTION TO THE VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate:</b> Aluna may bring a lawsuit
        solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the
        Web Portal or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example,
        trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first
        engaging in the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

      <p>
        <b
          >YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ALUNA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND
          MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS,
          CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS
          ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH
          OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE.</b

          and stating that You (first and last name) decline this dispute

        If You opt-out of the dispute resolution process described in this
        section, or if any matter is otherwise determined not to be subject to
        such dispute resolution process, You hereby submit to the exclusive
        jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
        California in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to these
        Terms. You agree that any and all claims and matters arising out of
        these Terms, unless subject to the dispute resolution process described
        above, may be heard and determined in any such court, and You hereby
        waive any right to object to such filing on grounds of improper venue,
        forum non-conveniens, or other venue-related grounds, unless such
        objection asserts that the claim or matter in dispute is subject to
        determination through the dispute resolution process described above.

      <p>
        You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or

        that You provide); and/or (ii) by posting to the Web Portal. For notices
        made by email, the notice will be effective as of the date the notice is
        first transmitted. You agree that any notice received from Aluna

      <h3>NO INADVERTENT WAIVER</h3>
      <p>
        The failure of Aluna to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
        will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or
        provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective
        only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
        Aluna. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by

        these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to
        the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms
        will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h3>SEVERABILITY</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or
        unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms remain in full
        force, provided that the essential terms and conditions remain valid,
        binding, and enforceable and the economic and legal substance of the
        transactions contemplated by these Terms are materially preserved.
